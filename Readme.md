# Terminal Screen Renderer
# The Project Is Still Under Development

This is a Python-based **Terminal Screen Renderer** project. It simulates rendering and managing a terminal screen using commands streamed as bytes. The project processes commands like drawing characters, rendering text, and clearing the screen. It is modular and easy to extend for future improvements.

---

## Features

- **Screen Setup**: Initialize a virtual terminal screen with specified dimensions and color mode.  
- **Draw Characters**: Update the screen at specific coordinates with characters and colors.  
- **Render Text**: Place multiple characters starting at a defined point.  
- **Clear Screen**: Reset the grid to an empty state.  
- **Byte Stream Parsing**: Process byte streams to execute commands dynamically.

## Project Structure

Here’s the folder and file structure for the project:

```
project/
├── main.py          # Main program for testing and running the screen
├── screen.py        # TerminalScreen class: Handles screen operations
├── parser.py        # ByteStreamParser class: Handles byte streams and commands
├── utils/           
│   ├── __init__.py  # Make utils a package
│   └── commands.py  # Command handler logic
├── tests/           
│   ├── __init__.py  # Make tests a package (optional)
│   └── test_parser.py # Tests for the ByteStreamParser
└── test_streams/    
    └── sample_stream.py # Sample byte streams simulating test input
```

---

## Requirements

- **Python 3.8 or higher**  
- A terminal or IDE that supports Python execution.

---

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kariuki11/TerminalScreen-BinaryToScreen
   cd project
   ```

2. **Verify Python Installation**:
   Ensure Python is installed by running:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

3. **Run the Main Program**:
   Execute the main program to see the terminal screen in action:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

---

## How to Test the Project

1. **Test the Parser**:  
   A test script `test_parser.py` is provided under the `tests/` directory. It uses sample byte streams defined in `test_streams/sample_stream.py`.

   Run the test using:
   ```bash
   python tests/test_parser.py
   ```

2. **Sample Byte Stream**:
   The sample byte stream simulates incoming data, like:
   ```
   SETUP 20 10 0
   DRAW 5 5 X red
   RENDER
   CLEAR
   TEXT 2 2 Hello World
   RENDER
   ```

   The output of each command will be displayed in the terminal.

## Example Output

Below is an example of the expected output:

```
Processing stream: SETUP 20 10 0
Screen initialized with 20x10, color mode: 0

Processing stream: DRAW 5 5 X red
Drawn 'X' at (5, 5) with color 'red'

Processing stream: RENDER
[Empty rows]
     X
[Empty rows]

Processing stream: CLEAR
Screen cleared.

Processing stream: TEXT 2 2 Hello World
Text rendered starting at (2, 2): "Hello World"

Processing stream: RENDER
  Hello World
[Other rows]
```
